# FireText API Sample Calls (Basic) - C# Jumpstart
Basic console application showing how to call the FireText API for sending SMS Text Messages via C#

## How do I run it?

- Set up a [FireText](https://www.firetext.co.uk) account.
- Get your [api key](https://app.firetext.co.uk/settings/manage/api/).
- Clone this repository.

Then:
- Open it in Visual Studio 2015 (or greater).
- Update Program.cs with your api key.
- Update ApiCalls/SendSms_Basic.cs -> SendSms method variables as appropriate.
- If trying to receive messages you will need to set up a number with FireText.
- Debug the sample.

The sample runs on .NET 4.6. You can easily port it to .NET Core with just a couple of tweaks.

You can build on these samples using the documentation no the FireText [website](https://www.firetext.co.uk/docs).
